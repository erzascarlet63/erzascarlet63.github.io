# Introduction 

Hi! I’m the human equivalent of a loading screen that never quite reaches 100%. I drink water like it’s a personality trait, get excited over snacks more than major life events, and can trip over flat surfaces with Olympic-level skill. If you ever need someone to overthink simple decisions or laugh at their own jokes before finishing them—congratulations, you’ve found your person. (AI-Generated)
