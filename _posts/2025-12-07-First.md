## My Love

From the moment I first saw you, my world has been brighter than I ever could've imagined. You brought colors to my life that I didn't even know existed, and every day since has been a journey of discovering how deepl I care for you. My love for you runs deeper than the ocean, streching far beyond the horizon where the sky kisses the sea, endless and unwavering

## My Apology

I am truly sorry for everything I've done that may have hurt you or made you feel ignored, unheard or unimportant. I know I've hurt you by repeating the same mistakes and not fully listening to what you've shared. I see now that my actions have made you feel dismissed and tired, and I take the responsibility for that. I understand how my carelessness addedd weight to your feelings, and I'm truly sorry for the pain it caused. I want to give us both space to breathe, reflect and slowly find a gentler way forward. Please understand that it was never my intention to make you feel less than cherished. I know I keep saying the same words "I am sorry" over and over, and I understand that it may sound repetitive or even empty at times. When I say that every apology comes from the bottom of my heart. 

Time may ebb and flow, and life may pull us in different directions, but my devotion to you remains an eternal current, always  bringing me back to you. Even when we drift or far apart, my heart holds you close, and every beat carries the hope of making things right. 

> Love is like the ocean, deep and ever-moving,
Sometimes calm, sometimes stormy, yet always alive.
I feel the pull of your waves, the warmth of your tides,
Even when currents clash, I cannot stop being drawn to you.

## You

You are my horizon, my calm in every storm, my deepest joy, and my greatest treasure. I may keep repeating my apologies, but it is only because I cannot bear the though of hurting or losing the precious bond we share. I hope with time, my actions can show you the sincerity of my words and the depth of my love, because nothing in this world matters more to me than you.

>Love is like the ocean, endless and deep,
Sometimes whispering softly, sometimes roaring in leaps.
I feel the pull of your waves, the warmth of your tides,
And I want to be with you too, where our hearts collide.



## Healing

>Together we could drift, side by side,
Riding the currents, letting the waters guide.
In every swell and every calm, I find you,
And in this vast ocean, I am home with you.

Perhaps this is what healing truly is: not the abilty to let go easily, but the understanding of what is truly worth holding onto. Not the power to walk away, but the courage to stay and be stayed with you. Love is such a beatiful feeling, sayang, isn't?
